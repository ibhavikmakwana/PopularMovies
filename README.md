### API Key

The app uses themoviedb.org API to get movie information and posters. You must provide your own [API key][1] in order to build the app.

Just put your API key into `value` resource folder's `strings.xml` file:

```<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="api_key">YOUR_API_KEY</string>
</resources>
```
